AI-Era Essential Skill: Distinguishing Simple/Complex vs Easy/Hard
1. Introduction
In the AI age, one critical skill matters deeply for humans more than ever before:
Accurately distinguishing Complex vs Simple (conceptual structure and complexity)
Clearly identifying Hard vs Easy (practical difficulty, efforts required).
2. Recognizing Clearly What is Easy/Simple vs Hard/Complex
(And correcting common misconceptions along the way)

Simple + Easy: Routine tasks easily automated by AI (reminders, simple calculations).
Simple + Hard: Visually-related tasks (drawing, recognizing subtle visual patterns, Go)—conceptually clear but practically demanding.
Misconception clarified here clearly: artists mistakenly think visual tasks must also be structurally complex because they seem so hard.
Complex + Easy (For Humans): Language skills (structured grammar, nuanced usage), complex but intuitive because humans evolved specifically around language.
Complex + Hard: Abstract reasoning tasks, multi-dimensional strategy games (e.g., Dota), math, philosophical reasoning—conceptually demanding AND practically challenging.
3. Clearly Understanding AI's True Capability Across the Spectrum
Explain clearly and concisely:

Simple/Easy tasks: reliably solved by basic AI automation; no longer special.
Simple/Hard tasks: Huge success area for current AI (computer vision, style imitation, Go)—AI highly useful and valuable here.
Complex/Easy tasks: Partial success by current AI (LLMs, language generation, basic summarization); successful imitation/pattern matching but struggles with deeper reasoning clearly.
Complex/Hard tasks: Massive unsolved territory for AI—abstract mathematical proofs, rigorous scientific reasoning, human-like creative synthesis, deep causal inference still remain "frontier," requiring major careful human supervision or not yet at human-like general intelligence.
4. Practical Recommendation and Conclusion
Develop clearly the skill of accurately categorizing simple/hard/complex/easy reliably: a powerful meta-skill for making smarter AI-related decisions.
Prioritize AI applications that convert "practically hard tasks" into "easy and automated" solutions.
Set carefully realistic expectations clearly about AI in genuinely complex/hard domains—clearly acknowledging the current frontiers and limitations.
