# Understanding Data Types and Quantization in LLMs (Updated with DeepSeek Insights)

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek have revolutionized AI. But running them efficiently requires high computational power and memory. To improve speed and lower resource usage, researchers often experiment with different data types and quantization strategies.

In this post, letâ€™s clearly understand different data types ("dtypes") commonly used for LLMs, and why they matter. We'll also dive into what quantization means, how it impacts LLM performance, and discuss recent practical improvementsâ€”including a quick update on a recent open-source model named **DeepSeek**.

## What are Data Types in LLMs and Why Do They Matter?

Every number in a machine-learning model is stored using a data type, which determines two main things:

- **Precision**: How accurate is the number representation?
- **Memory usage**: How much storage is required?

Different data types have different tradeoffs:

| Data Type | Precision | Memory Usage | Common use-case |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| float32 | Very high precision | Large (32-bit) | Training standard, high stability |
| float16 (fp16) | Medium-high | Medium (16-bit) | GPU mixed-precision training |
| bfloat16 (bf16) | Medium-high (stable exponent) | Medium (16-bit) | Commonly used on GPUs/TPUs; balances precision & memory |
| int8 | Lower precision (integer range) | Small (8-bit) | Optimized inference |
| int4 | Low precision | Smallest (4-bit) | Extreme compression, specialized inference |

Typically:

- **float32** is the default precision for initial model trainingâ€”highly accurate but memory-intensive.
- **fp16 and bf16** provide balance between accuracy and memory savings. They're popular for training large models efficiently.
- **int8 and int4** drastically reduce memory usage for inference (running a trained model), enabling deployment to smaller devices or increasing inference speed.

## Quantization Explained Simply

Quantization means converting a model from higher-precision data types (like float32 or float16) into lower-precision formats (like int8 or int4).

The process generally involves converting:

- **Weights** (model parameters)
- Sometimes **Activations** (intermediate calculations during inference)

### How Quantization Improves LLM Efficiency

| Benefit | Explanation |
|----|---------|
| Faster inference | Smaller data types mean quicker computation on compatible hardware. |
| Lower memory requirements | Reduced precision frees memory, enabling larger models on fewer resources. |
| Portable & Accessible | A smaller quantized model runs better on CPUs, edge devices or users' local machines. |

Consider LLaMA as a concrete example (from Neural Magic benchmark):

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Accuracy drop (W8A8 configuration) | Negligible (<1%) |
| Inference speed improvement | ~2.4Ã— |
| Model size reduction | ~3.5Ã— smaller |

(The "W8A8" notation means weights in 8-bit, activations in 8-bit.)

Quantization lets you have "nearly the same accuracy but significantly faster models."

## Quick Update: Recent Open-source Models (DeepSeek Example)

Recently DeepSeek, a promising open-source LLM, demonstrated advanced quantization techniques. While this post focuses mainly on foundational techniques (fp16, bf16, int8, int4), DeepSeek has pioneered a new approach called **FP8 quantization**. 

FP8 (8-bit floating point) provides remarkable results for both training and inference, balancing compute efficiency with stable accuracy. We'll clearly describe FP8 and its impact in a dedicated future post.

## Practical Considerations for Using Quantized Models

When choosing a quantized LLM (such as GPTQ-quantized LLaMA or models on Hugging Face), understand the following naming conventions and their implications:

- **Q8_0**: 8-bit quantized weights only, activations remain higher precision (such as float16).
- **Q4_K_M**: Advanced 4-bit quantization techniques, usually balancing reduced size with minimized accuracy loss.
- Model file names like **`model-name.W4A16.gguf`** clearly define data strategies:
  - W4: Weights are quantized in 4-bit integers.
  - A16: Activations remain at higher precision (typically fp16 or bf16).

Always pick quantization formats compatible with your hardware, as efficiency gains highly depend on hardware support:

- GPUs with dedicated support (like NVIDIA Turing, Ampere, Hopper)
- CPUs with INT8 acceleration (Intel CPUs with VNNI)
- Edge accelerators (Appleâ€™s Neural Engine)

_Hardware choice matters_: on older CPUs or GPUs, reduced-precision models sometimes perform slower or see less benefit.

## Summary and What's Next?

Quantization strategies and clever dtype choices are crucial to efficiently running modern large language models. Learning how to use float16, bf16, int8, or int4 properly allows you to optimize for speed, resource-efficiency, and deployment accessibilityâ€”all while minimizing accuracy loss.

Recent LLMs like DeepSeek push quantization even further, leveraging newly developed FP8 precision. But FP8 deserves deeper scrutiny: Stay tuned for my next post, where I'll carefully unpack FP8 quantization, exploring why models like DeepSeek chose it and how it significantly improves LLM performance and efficiency at groundbreaking model scales.
