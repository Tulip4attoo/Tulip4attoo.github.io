# Working

What I’m doing now:

Doing a lot of shit in my company. But I dont really love to talk about it here (still write blog post tho).

Get to know a bit about marketing stuff. Have a decent one from Chris course (howtomarketagame). Choosing to making games because I think it is easier/suitable for me.

Currently doing 2 games at this time (not very wise choice I guess), code name antiem and Biab. Hope that I could have something to show here (and youtube) before the end of this year.


# Old things

### Jun - Jul 25:
The walk app pivoted into a web, with this spirit: Pick a story, roam around as a character, interact with places, and talk with others.

Tagline: roam, talk, unravel.

I made it as a site. I did some marketing and found it is hard to do marketing (I have no knowledge yet). Make some shorts, get thousands of views but not a register.

Learnt a lot:
+ doing the code, CI/CD, publishing a site, etc. (but forgot most of it, not really hard tho).
+ first time doing some serious marketing stuff. Posting in social media is terrify for me at first.
+ I should have a sales/marketing framework.


Plan to release an App about motivating people to walk/run with LLM stories. This Apr.

Launch Echo streamer (drop)
